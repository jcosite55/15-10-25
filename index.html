                it was nice to know u, rama. and i do really glad that i got the chance to meet you even if it just once. youâ€™re such a genuinely kind and caring person that you might deserve all the good things this world has to offer. Iâ€™m honestly grateful that our paths crossed, even for a brief time. It was short, but meaningful enough.
